By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[41]Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[43] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth."

    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and
        found habitability. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains
        liquid surface water. Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar
        ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands.
        Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain
        ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the
        magnetosphere of Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.

        The atmosphere of Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon
        dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in the
        atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions
        than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's climate is governed not
        only by latitude but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas, severe weather, such
        as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heat waves, occurs and greatly impacts life.

        Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of
        the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun
        and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. The Earth rotates around its own
        axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with
        respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one
        permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a
        quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces the Earth with the same side, which
        causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

        Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar
        System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it.
        Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event
        two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of 8 billion today.
        Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the
        planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening
        the livelihood of humans and many other life, causing widespread extinctions</p>
